# 1. ALGOSOLVER

Learn Data Structures & Algorithms by Understanding the Approach

AlgoSolver is a smart DSA learning platform that teaches students how to think, not just how to code.
It helps learners understand multiple solution approaches through step-by-step explanations, clean code generation, and audio-guided reasoning.

Instead of focusing only on final answers, AlgoSolver emphasizes approach-based learning, helping students build real problem-solving skills.

## 2. Project Description

While learning Data Structures and Algorithms, many students struggle not because they can’t find solutions, but because they don’t understand how to arrive at them. 

Most platforms present final code without explaining the reasoning behind it.
AlgoSolver bridges this gap by breaking down problems into multiple approaches, explaining each step clearly, and guiding learners through logic, syntax, and efficiency trade-offs.

## 3. Installation / Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to run AlgoSolver locally:

1. git clone https://github.com/dhanashrishah1306-svg/AlgoSolver.git

2. cd AlgoSolver

3. npm install

4. npm start

5. Open your browser and visit:  http://localhost:3000


Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
The application runs locally without any external paid services.

## 4. Usage

1. Enter a Data Structures or Algorithms problem.

2. Choose a programming language (Python, C++, Java, etc.).

3. Submit the query to generate results.

4. Explore:

      - Multiple solution approaches

      - Clean and executable code

      - Step-by-step explanations

      - Syntax and logic breakdown

      - Audio explanations

      - Time and space complexity comparisons

This end-to-end flow simulates learning from a mentor, not just reading a solution.
